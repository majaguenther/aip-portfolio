# Image Recognition AI
Since I started the portfolio with experimenting with Teachable Machine - so Image Recognition, 
I think it's a nice wrap up to end the first period with the implementation of an Image Recognition AI.

My original plans to base this on a friends research project didn't work out, due to miscommunication,
so instead I followed along a [Youtube video][YT]. The tutorial is using a [dataset from Kaggle][KG] for
training and testing. 

This directory includes the [code][ipynb], the input and output data, and a [report][rp].
