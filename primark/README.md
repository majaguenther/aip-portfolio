# Primark's AI usage

After watching a [Youtube Video][YV] about Primark's business model, emphasizing that they are the only fast
fashion giant without an online shop, I got curious about the automations and AI systems they use, that allow
them to compete with brands like Zara or Shein. 

While there is a lot of literature about automation in the fast fashion industry, I did decide to focus
rather on articles about the brand and their success, than research reports that only acknowledge the brand
briefly.

I wrote my findings and thoughts down in a two page [report][rw].
