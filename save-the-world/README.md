# Why AI Will Save the World

A recent brain-breaking lecture (I wish I would remember the whole context) lead me to looking up:
*is ai ruining our society* on Google Scholar, because sometimes you just need scientific backup for your
theses.

Jokes aside, I did look that up because if I'm gonna learn something, might as well incorporate it into the
learning plan. Instead of AI critical sources I stumbled upon an essay with the title: 
**[Why AI Will Save the World][pdf]** by Marc Andreessen. Unbeknownst to me, I found a commented version
with notes from Alan Jacobs, but the notes were very helpful in my [review][rv].

I decided to read this paper, because I imagine it to be so peaceful, thinking, that AI will solve not only
my problems, but also all the problems. And how will I ever get to that point if I don't listen to people
with such world views. 

I would've loved to be convinced.
