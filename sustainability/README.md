# Sustainability effects of generative AI

Generative AI has slowly settled into our everyday life. While sustainability concerns raise from time to time, 
I myself must admit, that I do not have a good understanding of the effects.

Therefore, I have accumulated a [student research project][SP] about the Sustainability effects of generative AI.
It was written by three of my classmates at the Berlin School of Economics and Law, over the course of six months.

I wrote down my key takeaways.
