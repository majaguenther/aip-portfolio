# Miniaturwunderland Hamburg

The Miniature Wonderland is the largest model railway system in the world.
It is located in Hamburg's *Speicherstadt* and is one of the most
visited sights in Germany.

The exhibition includes around 1230 digitally controlled trains with more than
12.000 wagons. The exhibitions also include around 5.280 houses and bridges,
more than 11.800 vehicles, of which some drive independently, and 25 airplanes.

There is also a system featuring recurring day-night lighting cycles and almost
500.000 built-in LED lights. [^1]

I will learn about the exhibitions AI usage in their many features out of interest and then share
m findings in a report.
## I postponed this project, why?
I went to Hamburg in the end of September. We were planning on visiting the Miniaturwunderland,
but were too big of group to go at the same time slot. Since I am going to Hamburg again, to 
meet my family for my birthday (Hamburg is more or less halfway to Berlin), I am forcing them
to go to the Miniaturwunderland then instead. 

As we are visiting in week 11, I have moved this to week 10.
