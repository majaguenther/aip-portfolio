# Image recognition with [Teachable Machine][TM]

After being introduced to the Teachable Machine in From Data To Value I, I thought of fun ideas to further test
what we learned that day and decided to make a model with pictures of my parents. Training one class with
pictures of my dad and one class with pictures of my mom will allow me to upload pictures of myself, or even use
the camera feature, and let the model decide, who I look more alike.

It felt like a simple use case and a good example to show my parents what I do at uni, while not boring them
too much with details.

This directory includes all used training- and test-data, the model, and a [report][rp].
