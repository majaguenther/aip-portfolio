# Movies
While AI usage in the movie industry is steadily increasing, this chapter of my learning plan concerns movies ABOUT AI,
so how AI is portrayed in mainstream media and then again, how that portrayal in perceived from society.

I, pretty much the opposite of a movie-nerd, as my attention span lasts about 20s, have researched movies
covering AI and/or autonomous machines. Not all of them are available on platforms I am subscribed to.
