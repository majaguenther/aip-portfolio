# Prof. Dr. Monett Díaz' stance on AI

Prof. Dr. Monett Díaz is the head of the Computer Science department at the Berlin
School of Economics and Law.  Her research focuses on Artificial Intelligence
and Software Engineering. She is also the course coordinator of the AI course.

My initial plan was to analyze and understand her opinion on AI, by looking through 
her [LinkedIn][LI] and reading through the linked articles and posts.

As a deliverable I was planning on submitting an analysis and conclusion in text form.

## I postponed this project, why?
I have not discarded the idea yet, because I do follow her on LinkedIn and the 
occasional posts I read do spark my interest.

But Prof. Dr. Monett Díaz is posting/commenting/reposting 40 to 50 posts a week. 
That was simply beyond my capacities in the past weeks. 

I was planning on assessing significant changes or contradictions, which would require
a long therm analysis = more posts.

## Solutions
I contemplated building an AI agent that helped me allow to log posts over a certain
amount of time and already categorize/summarize them, but LinkedIn  prohibits 
unauthorized data scraping. I wrote my research in that direction into a [short report][sr].

Instead of LinkedIn posts, I could also just read Prof. Dr. Monett Díaz' [publications][pub]
as most of them concern AI. There is still an overwhelming amount of those, but they are
definitely less frequent and also more in depth.

The third option is analyzing the LinkedIn account for a shorter, set period of time and 
then still looking into her publications.
