# Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics, and Society
The [AI safety book][book] is course textbook, developed by Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety, 
and aims to provide an accessible introduction to students, practitioners and others looking 
to better understand these issues.

It was recommended in the week 4.2 AIP lecture.

Sadly it's a really long book so I haven't gotten around to reading it yet. I am planning on doing so in the
second period and will report on my key takeaways.
